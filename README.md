# atpp-tbb-dpll


Davis Putnam Logemann Loveland (DPLL) algorithm in C++.
Forked from https://github.com/Wenling/DPLL-Algorithm

Disclaimer: do not use it for serious real-world problems -- I warned you!


## Plan

1. Code quality: cleanup
2. Parallelize: using TBB


## Tooling

* Format with .clang-format
* See Makefile: clang's -Weverything produces extensive diagnostics
